<h1>Computing</h1>
<p>As with all of my A- Levels I have not done my coursework yet as I am due to start this next year. However the idea that I have had for this has been that of a simulation of a network of routers.</p>
<h2>The plan</h2>
<p>I am planning on making this to look into the effects that the way that the different routers decide to go could have on the effectiveness of the system and to be able to code a system that will be able to create a random network that may have issues from time to time. This systems aim will likely be at a network engineer as to find the way that the router should try and find out where the information to get to the right destination is and by doing this on any random network be able to see what networks benefit from what. My part of this will to be able to code a program that at first would create all of the things that are needed for this process with inclusion of some abstractive thinking. I have a great interest in this as I am very interested in the ability for computers to be able to learn by themselves with little input after the start of the program, this will be quiet challenging of a task with all of the components that may go wrong such as the need for a fitness generator for each of the systems needed to be implemented. Not only this that will also be some issues with the creation of a realistic model of the routers to make sure that is no pre-emption of information and that each router only get what they try to find out instead of having the real information. This will be an interesting thing to look at and to try and fix which is the reason that I will choose this topic.</p>
